Scientific Side project regarding protein lipid motifs

Some remember notes:
regarding cb5b00810_si_001.pdf: in this study only the high confidense interactions are seen as interactions the others are seen as non-interactions.

In the cb5b00810_si_001 study we are only aswell using high confidense interactions, therefore only cb5b00810_si_001.csv file is of interest in analysis.

The PNAS files needs some extra work, non-standard identifiers and not sure what proteins are interacting with.
